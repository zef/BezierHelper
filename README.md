# BezierHelper

A Swift library that makes it easy to create (and modify) bezier paths from raw arrays of points.

# Features

- Allows creating UIBezierPath from an array of coordinates that's exported from something like [Drawscript](http://drawscri.pt) for Adobe Illustrator.
- Allows shifting the entire path by a certain amount.

# TODO

- [ ] Make sure it works when included as a framework
- [ ] Might add a mechanism to set an absolute start point. Would set the shift based on the original anchor point.
